This work gives a brief introduction into machine learning, especially artificial neural 
networks. It represents deep learning and some deep models used to develop the hand 
detection system. It describes the process of collecting and preparing the dataset used for 
model training. The procedure of deep model training using the Tensorflow Object Detection 
application programming interface is presented, and the results of each model are presented.
